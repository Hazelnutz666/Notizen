On your RD Session Host servers only (not your broker), please delete the following registry value:

HKLM\ SYSTEM\ CurrentControlSet\ Control\ Terminal Server\ WinStations\ RDP-Tcp

SSLCertificateSHA1Hash REG_DWORD

NOTE: Again, do not delete the above value from your broker. Only your RDSH servers.

After making the above changes, please test to make sure the issue has been resolved.
